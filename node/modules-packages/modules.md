<h2 id='whatModule'> what are packages?</h2>

a package contains multiple modules (blocks of code) that we can import into our Node.JS project. 

We can make our own blocks of code and import them from other files or use the many packages which are ready to be used.

***NPM*** (node package manager) is  a piece of software which manages packages and lets you download them with ease.

These packages have a JSON file usually with the name, version number license etc of the package.
