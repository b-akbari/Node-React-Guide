# Node - React guide
 This is a guide i will be working on written with beginners getting started with node and react in mind. It is written as a guide, but can also act as a resource to refer to as a refresher.

# Before you start

* ### each subject (Node, React) is contained in a seperate folder. each subject has topics within.

* ### i recommend following the topics sequentially as they do build on eachother. 

* ### Each topic has a Markdown file explaining the topic and subtopics within it. The topic folders also have files you can run to see an example in action if you need to see a full example.

* ### clone or fork this repository for ease of access in testing out the files.

* ### As you go through this guide, play around with the ideas and create your own files within each topic to make the concepts stick!
